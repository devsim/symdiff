Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Release 1.0.0 (May 7, 2019)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The version number has been updated to having a major revision of ``1``.  We adopt the semantic version numbering presented at https://semver.org.  The version number can be accessed through the |python| interface using the ``symdiff.__version__`` variable.

This is the first versioned release of |symdiff|.  Using the stable ABI, the software is able to run newer |pythonthree| releases, without rebuilding the software.

Unlike previous revisions of software, |pythontwoseven|, is removed from the build.
